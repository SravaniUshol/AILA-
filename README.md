 OBJECTIVES  
The AI Legal Assistance Project aims to create a user-friendly legal information system that 
will help both lawyers and everyday individuals find relevant legal information for their 
specific situations or questions. Here are the main goals of the project: 
1. Intelligent Information Retrieval : We want to design a system that makes it easier for 
users to identify legally relevant information tailored to their needs, whether they are legal 
professionals or not. 
2. Automated Case Retrieval : The project will include a mechanism that automatically 
fetches the most relevant past court cases from a database of Supreme Court of India 
judgments. This will be based on the specifics of a userâ€™s legal query. 
3. Statutory Provision Identification : Our goal is to help users understand the applicable 
laws for their situation by identifying the relevant sections of Indian statutes, clarifying the 
legal foundations of their issues. 
4. Case Retrieval Modeling : We will approach case retrieval as a semantic matching 
problem. This means we will focus on ensuring that our system provides results that closely 
mirror how courts have handled similar cases in the past. 
5. Statute Identification Modeling : For statute identification, we will explore two 
approaches: an unsupervised method based on semantic similarity, or a supervised approach 
that uses labeled training data to detect relevance. 
6. Bridging the Legal Knowledge Gap : One of our key aims is to make legal expertise 
more accessible. We want to create a preliminary legal analysis tool that helps users 
comprehend how their issues fit within the broader legal landscape, what actions they might 
take, and the outcomes from similar cases in history. 
7. Enhancing Legal Accessibility : By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and 
machine learning, we plan to improve efficiency in the legal field, allowing us to process 
extensive amounts of legal texts, statutes, and case law specific to the Indian context 
efficiently.
